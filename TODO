- Do reverse lookups ourselves
- Add /stats endpoint with some performance metrics
- Implement find closest server with backups, no request should ever fail even if the main server goes down
- Rename repo to proxy to avoid specifying -o <not cache> (go build: build output "cache" already exists and is a directory)
